    <td>Today I spent my time looking at codecademy, instead of GitHub.
The strategy that was best effective was not to talk as much. This allowed me to speed through exercises so I got further into the program</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limits my learning today was the work itself, I really struggled and spent a lot of time on the first couple of questions. </td>
