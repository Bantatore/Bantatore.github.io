Hi guys bantatore here back with another post about my codecademy! Today has been a very good lesson, not just because we had a cover teacher, but also i got to 42% in my codecademy course. The only thing that help back my progress was that billy and I were messing around for the first 5 minutes. I learnt by asking Anish for a liitle cklue if i got stuck and then i worked it out from there,.

The thing that i will change for next time is not to ask anish and try to be independant, and persevere for myself.
