Hi guys, Bantatore here, and today I have extended my shop, and created more columns to show buying in price, and profits.  I Have worked the buying in price, but have not managed to get the profits working yet. I have started off with a =MINUS command, which allows two columns to be subtracted from each other. 

Another thing  I encorporated was the discount scheme; if you shop at my shop enough, you will get given a 20% discount voucher, i have coded the cell, and made this take 20% off the final price. 

Thanks for reading:

Bantatore
