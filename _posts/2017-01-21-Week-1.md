Codecademy 

Todays lesson was the first lesson back after half term. We have moved on from the fuse boxes (finally), and have now moved onto coding Python. The first lesson was really fun! 

The Website is: [https://www.codecademy.com/](https://www.codecademy.com/) make sure you check it out!

Mr Keen also deleted my old blog, so I now have to start again, which is a shame. 

I hope that my new blog is better this my old one, because I feel I have learned more about how to code a website. 

Catch you in next week's blog. See you soon!
