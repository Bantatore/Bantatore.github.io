    <td>I learnt today by putting all the work I have been doing for the past 6 weeks of ICT into one lesson test. The strategies that were most effective were take notes of how Mr Keen did it and then put that knowledge into the work</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time is try and let the work I do in class and at home sync in, so I can easily display knowledge of the subject in lessons and tests to come. Also I think I should review each section myself and maybe make some notes on the topic and the main bits of code from that.</td>
