Who knew spread-sheets are fun?

In Computational Thinking, the new name for IT - given by Mr. Tansley, we have been working on spreadsheets.I think that i'm doing well, in the new subject, and I have successfully encoded a basic message and the decoded it successfully. I think that I am progressing at a good rate at which I will be able to make lots of progress.Last lesson we learnt how to concatenate. This is done by using the '=CONCATENATEâ€˜_ _formula. This puts all the text from a selection of cells into one cell. After this what we had to do was spread the all out again and make sure that we could decode it again. If we managed this then we had a working-decode encode system.Thanks for reading, see you next week!

Bantatore!
