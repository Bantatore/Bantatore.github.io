Hi guys, bantatore here with your weekly blog update. 

This half term, i have left the spreadsheets, and got back to nitty gritty code. We use a website called [repl.it](https://repl.it/). This is a site, where you can choose a language, and practice commands, which make up a programme, which you can make for scratch in raw code. For the past few lessons, we have been using Phython3.

 I have started to make a program using python3. I would have embedded that into my blog, but have forgotten the details of it, so i have put in one i did a couple of months back in, just to show you want we have been doing in our lessons lately.

Here is the code!
