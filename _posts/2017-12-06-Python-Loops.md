Hi guys bantatore here with the second week of blogging about Python 3. 

In today's lesson, looked at loops - the for() loop and the while() loop. 

The for() loop is used for a sequence in order. 

The While() loop is used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever. For example:

As you can see, these loops construct and serve different purposes. The *for* loop runs for a fixed amount of time,  while the while() loop runs until the loop condition changes. You could use a *for* loop with a huge number in order to gain the same effect as a *while* loop, but what's the point of doing that when you have a construct that already exists?
